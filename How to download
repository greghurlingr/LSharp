## Getting Started with L#

### 1. Install L#

Clone the repository and install any required dependencies for the interpreter:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LSharp.git
cd LSharp
# For example, if L# is written in Python:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Write Your First L# Program

Create a new file with the `.ls` extension, for example `hello.ls`:

```ls
Print = lettervalue("10") = characters("2") = message("Hello, World!")
```

### 3. Run Your Program

Use the L# interpreter to run your `.ls` file:
```sh
python interpreter/main.py hello.ls
```
*(Replace with your interpreterâ€™s entrypoint if different.)*

### 4. Learn the Syntax

Check the [FUNCTIONS.md](docs/FUNCTIONS.md) file for a list of all available functions and their usage.

### 5. Build More

Try out UI elements and more complex logic:
```ls
myButton = button = size("100x40") = text("Click Me!")
usernameLabel = label = text("Username:")
```
